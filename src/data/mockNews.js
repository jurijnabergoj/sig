      Primož Trubar (1508–1586) was a Slovene Protestant reformer, best known as the author of the first book printed in the Slovene language. 
      He was a key figure in the Protestant Reformation and laid the foundation for the development of the Slovene literary language.
      
      His most famous works include the *Catechismus* and *Abecedarium*. Trubar also helped shape national identity by promoting Slovene in print when Latin and German dominated. 
      His legacy is celebrated every year on June 8th, known as Trubar Day in Slovenia.
